Cleanup script to fix duplicate week entries.

Problem: Weeks were created with two different formats:
- "week_13" (from github_service.py)
- "Week 13" (from backfill_week_pod.py)

This script:
1. Identifies duplicate weeks
2. Migrates all PRs to use the correct format ("week_13")
3. Deletes the duplicate entries
